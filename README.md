# PROJECT 1 GA-SEIR: BUILD A GAME
## Who Wants To Be A Millionaire?

***
### Description
Who Wants to Be a Millionaire? is a trivia game show, where the contestant has to answer 15 questions, each of increasing difficulty, in order to win the million dollar jackpot. The game I created is much the same as the show's version with only slight variations. Each question is worth a certain amount of money. However, the amounts are not cumulative. If at any point the player answers a question incorrectly, they will lose the game and go home empty handed. The player has the option of two life-lines if they are unsure of the answer: "fifty/fifty" and "phone a friend". Once they have been used, however, they cannot be used again for the remainder of the game.
